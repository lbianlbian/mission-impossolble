            <h3> Mission ImposSOLble is the Solana tutorial I wish I had when I learned Solana programming. </h3>
            <p>Learning Solana has been described as "eating glass", and I certainly ate plenty of glass while learning.
                Solana does not need to be this hard though, so I've built Mission ImposSOLble to teach you the battle-tested concepts I use everyday at <a href = "https://purebet.io" target = "_blank"> Purebet </a> in a fun and effective manner.
            </p>
            <h1> With Mission ImposSOLble, you can unlock the power of what is possible only on Solana! </h1>
            <h2> What makes Mission ImposSOLble better?</h2>
            <h3> Less glass chewing </h3>
            <p> Lots of Solana tutorials go something like this.  </p>
            <p> Tutorial: Download this </p>
            <p> You download it</p>
            <p> Tutorial: Install this</p>
            <p> You install it</p>
            <p> Tutorial: Run this command</p>
            <p>You run the command.</p> 
            <p> Tutorial: Everything works now!</p>
            <p> Your console looks like this: </p>
            <img src = "errors.png"  class = "examples"/>
            <p> To avoid this situation, I've designed Mission ImposSOLble to use the simplest tools and minimize setup.</p>
            <p> Everything is done through REST API calls for now. In the future everything will be done through whatever is most simple to set up.</p>
            <p> This tutorial also uses Solana devnet, used for testing, so that you don't have to go through the difficulty of setting up a local Solana node. </p>
            <h3> Read --> write --> draw </h3>
            <p> I tried to learn Solana by diving into Rust and trying to code an on-chain program. Looking back, I realize learning how to read the Solana blockchain first, then writing transactions, and then creating on-chain programs (drawing) would have saved me a lot of frustration.</p>
            <p> Lots of tutorials bring you straight to drawing without building the foundation, but not Mission ImposSOLble!</p>
            <h3> Fun story</h3>
            <p> Tutorials can be boring. Mission ImposSOLble spices up dry Solana programming with a fun secret agent story! Ethereum has cryptozombies.io, and a fun tutorial for Solana is long overdue. </p>
