            <h2> Congratulations! Thanks to your investigation, the IMF destroyed the supercomputer that powered The Entity. 
                However, a secret organization is believed to have transferred a smaller version of The Entity to a second computer. 
                This new AI is called The Mini Entity. 
                This secret organization gives orders via transactions on the Solana blockchain.
